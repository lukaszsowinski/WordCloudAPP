Predictive analytics applies powerful statistical and data mining techniques to large data sets in order to generate useful information, identify patterns and trends, and build models to predict future events.   Applications of these techniques are now transforming decision-making throughout business, government, healthcare, and academia.   The demand for professionals knowledgeable in this area is projected to grow rapidly in the coming years.  
Graduates of the MS in Data Mining and Predictive Analytics program will obtain a variety of skills required to analyze large datasets and to develop modeling solutions to support decision making.  They will also develop a specialization in either marketing analytics or healthcare analytics. The specialization in healthcare analytics builds upon our division’s undergraduate healthcare informatics major which is now in its fourth year.  The program aims to prepare students with the required qualifications to become "data mining analysts/engineers" or "predictive modelers".
Admission to the program is contingent upon an assessment of the candidate’s ability to successfully pursue graduate study.  This assessment will be made by examining previous academic performance, letters of recommendation, the applicant’s essay, work experience, performance on standardized exams (such as the GRE), and any other evidence that the admissions committee believes to be relevant.
