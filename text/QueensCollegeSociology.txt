Students sitting around table in Rosenthal library

For those who major in sociology, the purposes of the department are to introduce students to the sociological perspective in order to enhance their understanding of and participation in society; to prepare students for graduate study in sociology and other social and behavioral sciences, or for graduate and professional studies in social work, law, urban planning, journalism, and related fields; to equip students for junior-level positions in health, education, and welfare, public opinion and market research, or research and administration in large-scale public and private organizations (social science positions beyond the junior level in these areas usually require graduate training); to give students a basic understanding of sociology for teaching in the social sciences.
